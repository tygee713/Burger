# Eat-the-Burger
An eating-simulator app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and then proceed to devour them.  Yum.


### Overview

This web application was built using an Express server, MySQL database and the ORM Sequelize.  The goal was to be able to view, create and update database elements using Handlebars for templating the dynamic content.

### Getting Started

In order to download and run this web application, download the repository and type "npm install" in the command line.  You must put your database credentials in the config.json file under 'development'.  You can then type "node server.js" in the command line and navigate to 'localhost:8080/' in the browser.
